## Getting Started

The [/dist/](dist) and [/dist.v5/](dist.v5) folders include nested folders whose names correspond to theme names: [blazing-berry](dist/blazing-berry), [office-white](dist/office-white), and [purple](dist/purple). Each nested folder contains the following theme-related files:

1) Theme stylesheets that you can apply to your application. 
* **bootstrap.css** - a ready-to-use CSS file.
* **bootstrap.min.css** - a ready-to-use minimized CSS file.

2) Theme source files that you can [customize](#customization) to create your own theme.
* **_variables.scss** - a file with [v4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/theming/#variable-defaults) / [v5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/sass/#variable-defaults) variables.
* **_styles.scss** - a file with custom CSS rules.
* **{theme_name}.scss** - a theme file that imports variables, the default Bootstrap theme, and custom CSS rules. Do not change the *import* order is this file.

## Customization

Do the following to customize the theme source files and compile the resulting theme:
1. Clone or download this repository.
1. Open the **dist/{theme_name}/_variables.scss** file and modify [v4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/theming/#variable-defaults) / [v5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/sass/#variable-defaults) variable values. You can also add your own variables.
1. Open the **dist/{theme_name}/_styles.scss** file. Modify CSS rules or create custom rules. You can use a browser’s Developer Tools to [inspect UI elements](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/K18570/how-to-inspect-css-rules).
1. Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they do not exist on your machine.
1. Go to the folder where the **package.json** file is located. Open the console window and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
1. Execute the  `npm i --global gulp` command to install the [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) globally.
3. Run `gulp` to compile all themes once or `gulp watch` to turn on the watcher that recompiles themes as soon as you change source SCSS files. 

This creates two new CSS files (**bootstrap.css** and **bootstrap.min.css**) in each theme's folder or overwrites the existing files according to your changes.
